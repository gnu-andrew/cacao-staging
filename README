************************* README for CACAO version 0.15 ************************

The current sources of CACAO version 0.15 are a snapshot during development.
They will change in the near future and are badly documented. This version
is not intended for public distribution. It is made available only for
educational and research purposes.

To use the CACAO sources put the cacao015.tgz file in a newly created
directory and uncompress it using gzip and extract the files using tar.
Make sure you have installed gmake. Enter:

make config-alpha
make

After this you should have a working version of cacao and cacaoh. How to
invoke cacao and which class library has to be used is described at the
CACAO home page (http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/java/cacao/index.html).

Under Linux this version currently works only using the option -cf.
If you want to use the Digital Unix C-compiler change the variable $CC
in the Makefile from gcc to cc.

The Sparc port is unfinished and not working. So typing "make config-sparc"
makes no sense in the moment. Threads are currently also not supported.

For questions mail me at cacao@complang.tuwien.ac.at, for very urgent
questions mail me at andi@complang.tuwien.ac.at.

Have fun with CACAO
